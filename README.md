This is the old repository for pyroscope python integration. The new one is located [here](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-rs). It has better performance and advanced features such as dynamic tagging and more.

You can find documentation for python integration [here](https://pyroscope.io/docs/python/).
